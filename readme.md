This is a programme I created for migrating entries from one sqlite datatbase to the null entries of another, in this case, telegram messages in the sqlite database created by telegram_backup. This is so that more entries can be added to the database without disrupting the backup process and allows for lost messages to be taken from a friends database and inserted into null messages, without causing issues.
