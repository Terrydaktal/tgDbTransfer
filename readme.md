This is a programme I created for migrating entries from one sqlite datatbase to the null entries of another, in this case, telegram messages in the sqlite database created by telegram_backup. This is so that more entries can be added to the database without disrupting the backup process and allows for lost messages to be taken from a friends database and inserted into random empty messages (deleted messages), without causing issues. Media files will also be copied over from friend to home directory. If the home DB starts at 130k and your friend's goes from 0k-140k then some media files 130k-140k will begin to clash. The functionality to handle this will be simple - i will add this functionality if this is the case for me when telegram removes the 1m message cap and I can finally retrieve messages before June 2015 that I dont have due to deletion but my friend had originally. Seeing as the tool is mainly for my own situations, functionality will not be added in unless it is necessary for me.
